# task 1: System Monitoring Script
 *ðŸ“Œ Task: Use an appropiate Python library to display CPU and memory usage.*
Â  *âœ… Instructions:*

 *Install python lib using pip.*

 *Write a script that prints CPU and memory usage every few seconds.*

*Example output:*
*CPU Usage: 35% Memory Usage: 60%*

*Bonus: Extend the script to log this data into a file for future analysis.*

# System Monitoring Script

```bash
pip apt install python pip
```

# Task 2
API Interaction (Weather Data Fetching)
ðŸ“Œ Task: Write a Python script that fetches weather data from an API and processes the response.
âœ… Instructions:

Sign up at OpenWeatherMap and get a free API key.

Fetch weather details (temperature, weather condition, humidity) for a given city.

Example output:
Weather in Lagos: Temperature: 30Â°C Condition: Clear sky Humidity: 75%

Bonus: Modify the script to allow users to enter multiple city names.
___
Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key
Go to OpenWeatherMap and create an account.
Navigate to API Keys and generate a free API key.
Copy the API key for use in the script.

*You'll need the requests library to make API calls:*
```bash
pip3 install request
```
Create the Weather Fetching Script
Save the following script as weather_fetch.py:

```python
import requests

# Replace with your actual API key
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
BASE_URL = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

def get_weather(city):
    """Fetch weather data for a given city"""
    params = {
        "q": city,
        "appid": API_KEY,
        "units": "metric"  # Convert temperature to Celsius
    }
    
    response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        temperature = data["main"]["temp"]
        condition = data["weather"][0]["description"]
        humidity = data["main"]["humidity"]
        
        print(f"Weather in {city}: Temperature: {temperature}Â°C Condition: {condition.title()} Humidity: {humidity}%")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to get weather data for {city}. Check city name or API key.")

def main():
    """Allow user to enter multiple cities"""
    cities = input("Enter city names separated by commas: ").split(",")

    for city in cities:
        get_weather(city.strip())  # Remove extra spaces

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Run the script
```bash
python3 weather_fetch.py
```
